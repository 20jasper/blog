## Keep your resume in the stack

You only have until the fold[^1] to get my attention

[^1]: The fold is around the first 3 inches of a resume. Another guideline is the "6 second rule." Set a timer and see what you can read in that time

Try to understand what this candidate has experience in from just the content above the fold

It seems like they are a software engineer or a manager? They're at least tech adjacent?

Who knows—I know I don't have enough time to figure it out, and I'm definitely not subjecting anyone else to this nonsense

I would burn your resume, but that means there's a non–zero chance someone else is subjected to your resume

> If you printed out your resume and lit it on fire, there is a small chance [it lights] your curtains on fire. ... The fireman ... saw that you had VSCode ... open, and they go "Oh wow, you know how to code! My brother's cousin's Uncle works at this company downtown, and they've been looking for an engineer for the past two months <br/>

Instead, I'll take the safer route and atomize it

## Don't waste my time with fluff

If you write "Detail Oriented" on your resume. I will subconsciously look for spelling and formatting mistakes, I _will_ find one, and I _will_ judge you for it. I know it doesn't matter, but I don't care

If you write "trustworthy"—I don't believe you. Prove it to me through something you did or take it off your resume

## How are you different?
