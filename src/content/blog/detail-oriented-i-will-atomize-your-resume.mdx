## Keep your resume in the stack

You only have until the fold[^1] to get my attention

Try to understand what this candidate has experience in from just the content above the fold

It seems like they are a software engineer or a manager? They're at least tech adjacent?

Who knows—I know I don't have enough time to figure it out, and I'm definitely not subjecting anyone else to this nonsense

I would burn your resume, but that means someone else might be subjected to your resume

> If you printed out your resume and lit it on fire, there is a small chance [it] lit your curtains on fire. ... Thankfully the sprinkler put out the fire ... The fireman ... saw that you had VSCode ... open, and they go oh wow you know how to code my brother's cousin's Uncle works at this company downtown and they've been looking for an engineer for the past two months <br/>
