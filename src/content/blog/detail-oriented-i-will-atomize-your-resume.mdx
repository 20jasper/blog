## Keep your resume in the stack

You only have until the fold[^1] to get my attention

[^1]: The fold is around the first 3 inches of a resume. Another guideline is the "6 second rule." Set a timer and see what you can read in that time

Try to understand what this candidate has experience in from just the content above the fold

<FakeResume />

It seems like they are a software engineer or a manager? They're at least tech adjacent?

Who knows—I know I don't have enough time to figure it out, and I'm definitely not subjecting anyone else to this nonsense

I would burn your resume, but that means there's a non–zero chance someone else is subjected to your resume

> If you printed out your resume and lit it on fire, there is a small chance [it lights] your curtains on fire. ... The fireman ... saw that you had VSCode ... open, and they go "Oh wow, you know how to code! My brother's cousin's Uncle works at this company downtown, and they've been looking for an engineer for the past two months <br/>
> – <cite>Leon Noel[^2]</cite>

Instead, I'll take the safer route and atomize it

## Don't waste my time with fluff

If you write "Detail Oriented" on your resume. I will subconsciously look for spelling and formatting mistakes, I _will_ find one, and I _will_ judge you for it. I know it doesn't matter, but I don't care

If you write "trustworthy"—I don't believe you. Prove it to me through something you did and take it off your resume

"Results-oriented?" I don't see any results, and trust me, I've looked for at least 3 (count them, three) minutes

## How are you different?

If anyone could say what you have on your resume, what you have is a job description

How are you different from other software engineers? How are you different from engineers at your company or team? I want to know what _you_ did, not what your company does. I have access to Google after all

### Be more specific

I found this bullet point on a resume of a developer looking to pivot into tech

> Built site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using semantic structure

Amazing, you are a web developer! So why should I hire you over the 97828390829 other web developers from the stack of resumes to my right? I don't need earth-shattering impact, just _something_ to differentiate yourself. What's the coolest or most difficult thing you've done so far?

> Optimized mobile user experience through web components including animated overflow menus

Great—now we have something to talk about!

## What's the scale?

> Collaborated with open-source contributors to successfully implement a calendar system in our internal tool set, streamlining scheduling and enhancing team coordination for more efficient project management

This bullet reads to me like the candidate worked in open-source as a non-technical contributor. The team could have designed it from scratch or used an off the shelf tool like Calendly or Cal[^3]. I can only assume it's the latter

[^3]: If you haven't tried Cal, it's great! Open-source, free hosting for personal use, their own video call service. I couldn't connect outlook with Calendly, so I shopped around for alternatives. Cal has so many features that Calendly has behind a paywall

> Led open-source initiative to design and develop a calendar with React, Express, and MongoDB, consolidating community events and meetings for over 1,500 users

The candidate led the project, it's a custom calendar, _and_ it has users? Well why didn't you say so!
{/* could prob say something funnier here */}

## Please don't write your resume with ChatGPT

I'm begging you

If you've paid a sliver of attention, you'd know that I don't want fluff, and I want to know your achievements. ChatGPT cannot possibly know this information. Write down what you've done in a brag doc, or a journal of your day to day work

Feel free to ask for ways to word bullets, but burden is on you to distill your most impressive work
