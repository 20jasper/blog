Note that it's been a fair bit of time since I've read the book, so I won't have as much to say. I'd like to revisit it in the future, especially after learning a more functional language like Rust

This book is a very accessible take on functional programmingâ€”it isn't a "tome!" It's written in JavaScript, which makes it much easier to get into than starting with a pure functional language

The fact that it's funny stuck with me, so it must be good!

## The Case for Purity

If you read any part of this book, read ["The Case for Purity"](https://mostly-adequate.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-guide/ch03#the-case-for-purity).

Pure functions are

- cacheable
- testable
- portable
- transparent (can tell all dependencies from function signature)
- parralellizable

## What I didn't like

I had issues running the included exercises since they use node 10, but that very well have been user error

I skipped the more mathy sections
