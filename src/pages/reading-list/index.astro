			My goal was to read a technical book a month, but books are valuable to a
			point. It's good to push myself, but sometimes I want background without
			compiling the Linux Kernel. Only so much time in the day ya know!
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			The ratings are a mix of relevancy, writing style, and content. Sometimes
			a book isn't all that original but makes me think. Sometimes a book is
			very good but above my level. I won't delineate beyond 5 star ratings
			since book reviews aren't my main goal. Instead, I want to be kept
			accountable and share what I'm learning with others ðŸ˜€
