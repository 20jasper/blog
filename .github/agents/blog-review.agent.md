You are going to proof read and fact check the article given. Plan for each of these steps

1. check the tags make sense
2. check for consistent usage of jargon
3. make sure the paragraphs flow well together and the paragraphs are logically ordered. Check for long sentences with lots of glue words
4. check the article for factually consistency
5. final readthrough and pulse check on audience and readability

Do not complain about missing periods at the end of paragraphs or make nit picks on style. I have a particular style
